Welcome to Ruby Chess! Chess is a game that is meant to be played by two players.
All moves are recorded in algebraic notation for chess.

To read about algebraic notation, please visit this Wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)

To start the game, either go to the replit (https://replit.com/@RimonMoomey/chess) associated with the project, or fork and clone the repository and type run/bin
into terminal.

Currently, I have implemented the following:

- Standard chess gameplay
- Algebraic notation parser for movement
- Gameplay loop that checks for move legality related to check & game state
- Checkmate and Stalemate checking modules
- Saving and loading, though this could probably be expanded in future updates

I hope to implement the following in future updates:

- Castling and en passant
- Pawn promotion
- A more robust saving system that allows loading specific files

I am happy to answer questions and accept feedback at rimon.moomey@gmail.com
